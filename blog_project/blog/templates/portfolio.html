		<p class="center"><strong>Retro World</strong></p>
		<p>As part of my Web Development with Adobe Dreamweaver class, I developed a website for a fake (even though I would
		like it be real) retro video game company simply called Retro World. Though I built it through Adobe Dreameaver, 
		I used mostly self made icons, done in the 8-bit style, to keep the feeling very retro.

		<p class="center"><strong>Rolodex C++ Project</strong></p>
		<p>As a final project for my C++ course, I developed a program that acts like a Rolodex where you can display all contacts, 
		add contacts, search for a specific contact, flip to the next contact, and delete contacts. I constructed this using
		the Standard Template Library.

		<p class="center"><strong>Video Game Database Perl/Python/PHP Project</strong></p>
		<p class = "box">As a series of projects for my Survey of Perl/Python/PHP course, I created a simple database that would allow the user to
		input game information, such as game title, game type, and the release year, sort it, then save it as a text file
		to a hard drive in all three of the languages I learned in the course. Unfortunately, my PHP version is the only 
		one with web applications. I created the Perl and Python versions simply through a compiler, so they will have to
		be launched through the command line.

	<p class="center"><strong>Professional Website and Blog</strong></p>
	<p>This professional website of mine is also one of my personal projects. It is also th first I have completed after I graduated college in February 2017. It started off as a simple static website with CSS, but I have sense transitioned it to the Django framework so that I could add a blog to the site. I also added Bootstrap to make the CSS more fluid and clean. Right now, I am the only one able to make posts through the Admin fuction of the Django framework. However, it will post all posts created in chronological order with a timestamp.</p>

	<p class="center"><strong>SavePoint</strong></p>
	<p>This is a continuation of my collegiate Video Game Database projects. I am extending on those projects from taking the simple list generated by the program itself to a web application that fully utilizes a SQL Database with user authentication. I am utilizing ASP.NET Core with Visual Sutido Core so that I can fully understand how the framework operates and how it utilizes user authentication with a SQL Database.</p>
	<p>Right now, this is a work in progress. I will post updates on my blog as I get closer to completing this project. In the meantime, you can view my source code on my <strong>GitHub</strong> profile.</p>
