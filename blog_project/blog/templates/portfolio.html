		<p class="center"><strong>Retro World</strong></p>
		<p>As part of my Web Development with Adobe Dreamweaver class, I developed a website for a fake (even though I would
		like it be real) retro video game company simply called Retro World. Though I built it through Adobe Dreameaver, 
		I used mostly self made icons, done in the 8-bit style, to keep the feeling very retro.

		<p class="center"><strong>Rolodex C++ Project</strong></p>
		<p>As a final project for my C++ course, I developed a program that acts like a Rolodex where you can display all contacts, 
		add contacts, search for a specific contact, flip to the next contact, and delete contacts. I constructed this using
		the Standard Template Library.

		<p class="center"><strong>Video Game Database Perl/Python/PHP Project</strong></p>
		<p class = "box">As a series of projects for my Survey of Perl/Python/PHP course, I created a simple database that would allow the user to
		input game information, such as game title, game type, and the release year, sort it, then save it as a text file
		to a hard drive in all three of the languages I learned in the course. Unfortunately, my PHP version is the only 
		one with web applications. I created the Perl and Python versions simply through a compiler, so they will have to
		be launched through the command line.
